Follow these instructions to compile and install
the GAL compiler.

Once unzipped or untarred the gal package
execute:

make install

This should place the GAL executable
in the bin directory. Note that we use an optimizing
compiler for the architecture given the nature of the
project and almost certainty that we will be running the
executable on the platform it was compiled. 

To run one of the programs execute on a command line:

./bin/gal < test/good/<program name>

test/good/ and test/bad/ contain good
and purposefully faulty GAL scripts that
are used in testing.
